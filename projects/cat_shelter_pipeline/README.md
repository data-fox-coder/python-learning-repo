# Cat Shelter Pipeline 🐱

An end-to-end data pipeline that extracts real-world cat adoption data from the [RescueGroups.org v5 API](https://rescuegroups.org/services/adoptable-pet-data-api/), transforms it through a medallion architecture, and serves it via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Built to demonstrate practical data engineering skills in Python, using production-oriented patterns from a background in SSIS, Power Query M, and SQL Server.

## What It Does

| Stage | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Extract** | `requests` | Authenticates with the RescueGroups v5 API and fetches available cat listings |
| **Bronze** | JSON | Raw API response persisted as-is for auditability |
| **Silver** | `pandas` + Parquet | Flattens nested JSON, standardises column names, applies config-driven field selection and deduplication |
| **Gold** | `SQLAlchemy` + SQLite | Upserts clean records into SQLite — safe to re-run without duplicates |
| **Dashboard** | `Streamlit` | Interactive dashboard with filters, metrics and charts served from the gold layer |

## 🛠️ Resilient Architecture: Hybrid Bronze Extraction Layer

During development in cloud-hosted environments (like GitHub Codespaces), upstream API firewalls may intermittently flag data center outbound IP ranges, leading to connection resets (`RemoteDisconnected` or `Connection reset by peer` errors). 

To ensure continuous integration and pipeline reliability, the **Bronze Extraction Layer** implements a resilient hybrid design pattern:

1. **Live Ingestion (Primary):** The pipeline attempts an authenticated `POST` request to the RescueGroups v5 API using the strict `application/vnd.api+json` specification.
2. **Graceful Local Fallback (Secondary):** If a network boundary error or firewall block is encountered, the extraction layer intercepts the exception, issues a system warning, and automatically hot-swaps to a local structured dataset (`mock_rescuegroups_raw.json`).

This design decouples downstream data engineering logic (Silver deduplication/Parquet serialization and Gold SQLite upserts) from external network volatility, allowing for seamless end-to-end development and robust error handling in production.

## Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard reads from the gold SQLite layer and includes:

- **Summary metrics** — total cats, unique breeds, special needs count, cats with pictures
- **Age distribution** — bar chart across Baby / Young / Adult / Senior
- **Gender split** — pie chart
- **Top 10 breeds** — horizontal bar chart
- **Activity levels** — bar chart
- **Compatibility & characteristics** — % of cats OK with kids, cats, dogs, housetrained, special needs
- **Sidebar filters** — filter all charts by age group, gender, and activity level
- **Adaptive Matplotlib Visualizations:** Custom theme helper (`apply_chart_theme`) that dynamically detects Streamlit's base environment (light/dark mode), adjusting text, tick labels, and axis spines on transparent figure canvases without manual toggles.

The dashboard triggers the pipeline automatically on first load and refreshes data every 24 hours, using the `RESCUEGROUPS_API_KEY` secret configured in Streamlit Community Cloud.

> **Note for GitHub Codespaces:** Streamlit keeps running in the background even after you close the forwarded port tab. Stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal before ending your Codespaces session, otherwise it will keep consuming compute hours on your Codespaces usage quota.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with JSON and Parquet intermediate layers
- Resilient pipeline design (network exception handling and automated local data fallback logic)
- REST API authentication and data extraction with `requests`
- Nested JSON normalisation and transformation with `pandas`
- Config-driven pipeline design with `yaml`
- Upsert semantics (`INSERT OR REPLACE`) for idempotent loads via `SQLAlchemy`
- Secret management with `python-dotenv`
- Streamlit dashboard with pipeline bootstrap and staleness guard
- Dependency management with `pip-tools` (`requirements.in` → `requirements.txt`)
- Modular, production-oriented Python (not just a notebook)

## Getting Started

### 1. Get a RescueGroups API key

Sign up at [rescuegroups.org](https://rescuegroups.org) to request access to the v5 API.

### 2. Configure your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your key:

```
RESCUEGROUPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the pipeline

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

Or launch the dashboard — it will trigger the pipeline automatically if no data is found:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Configuration

Key settings are managed in `config.yml`:

```yaml
source:
  base_url: https://api.rescuegroups.org/v5
  page_size: 100       # max 250

layers:
  silver:
    fields_to_keep:    # config-driven field selection
      - id
      - attributes_name
      - attributes_agegroup
      # ... (23 fields total)
  gold:
    path: data/gold/cats/cats_shelter.db
```

---

## Dependencies

Managed with `pip-tools`. To update:

```bash
pip-compile requirements.in
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`, `streamlit`, `matplotlib`, `pyarrow`
